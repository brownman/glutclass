glutclass project
By Edward Kandrot

Wrote a small test class that can be used as a framework for experimenting with OpenGL.  One inherits the class Glut from glut.h, then overrides any of the setup or _event routines.  The _event routines are callback by the glut registered callbacks.

There are a few test cases as part of this package:
test0 - shows the basics of using glut.h
test1 - expands on test0, uses the pixmap class, overrides mouse to allow drawing into a bitmap
tes2 - 3d object follows the mouse around, overrides the passive mouse callback.

Tested on Windows and Linx.  The projects for Windows were created in Visual Studio 10.
