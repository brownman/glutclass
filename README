glutclass project
By Edward Kandrot

Testing out github.  Wrote a small test class that can be used as a framework for experimenting with OpenGL.

One inherits the class Glut from glut.h, then overrides any of the setup or event routines.  The event routines are registered callbacks from glut.

There are a few test cases as part of this package:
test0 - shows the basics of using glut.h
test1 - expands on test0, uses the pixmap class, overrides mouse to allow drawing into a bitmap


Where will it go
I have plans to add more callbacks to the base class.  Fill out other OpenGL classes, which I guess means I shouldn't have caled this project glutclass...  Still, this is mostly testing the waters of github.
